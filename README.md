# A programme for an access control system using smart cards

An ordinary user sends an http request with his smart card (simulated password). 
If there is one, the user receives a status of 200, as well as a message about successfully overcoming authentication.
For the admin, there are methods such as "Add user", "View all users", "View attempts to enter smart cards"
